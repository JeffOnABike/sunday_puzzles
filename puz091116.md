# Puzzle

Next week's challenge: Think of a well-known category with exactly seven things in it. Alphabetize the things from their ending letters, and the last letter alphabetically will be "e." In other words, no thing in this category ends in a letter after "e" in the alphabet. It's a category and set of seven things that everyone knows. What is it?

## Process

My thought process was first to think of phrases beginning with "seven."

I came up with:
- deadly sins
- dwarves (Snow White's)
- seas

When I entertained 'seas', I thought perhaps all of them end in 'c' like Pacific, Arctic, Atlantic, etc. Indian is an exception. By now my mind was on the track of geography, so it wasn't long before I thought about land masses.

## Solution

While there are a few different takes on the number of continents and what they are, I think many of us learned seven:
- North America
- South America
- Africa
- Asia
- Australia
- Antarctica
- Europe

I believe this meets the criteria of something "everyone knows" and the last one alphabetically (by last letter) ends in 'e'.

## Further Work
I found this puzzle to be easy. It's the first one I solved without using programming, and I think it was a little unusual in that the word transformation was minimal and really the main challenge was to come up with categories. At a later time, I may come up with a programmatic solution for this puzzle. Preliminary thoughts are to use:
- Google's API for search term autocompletions
- n-gram analysis from a large corpus (e.g. NY Times, Wikipedia)
- Finding a source of 'category' data
