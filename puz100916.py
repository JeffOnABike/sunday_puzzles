'''
Next week's challenge, from listener Darrell Myers of Somerville, Mass.: Name a famous actress of the past â€” first and last names, 10 letters altogether. Change one letter in the first name and one letter in the last. The result is a two-word phrase naming a food item often found in a kitchen cabinet or refrigerator. What is it?

best answer so far: Jean Porter > Bean Sorter
